description: "Data on Dogs in Switzerland."
---

The data is from Zurich, Switzerland, courtesy of the internet. The
idea to analyze this dataset comes from a [post on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/dogs-of-zurich?select=zuordnungstabellehunderassehundetyp.csv).

## Translation

German is the official language of Zurich most of the columns
are in German but the translations to English aren't too tricky. You
might need to use a translator.

* ALTER -> Age
* GESCHLECHT -> Gender (w = weiblich, female; m = mannlich, male)
* STADTKREIS -> City Quarter or District
* RASSE1 -> Dog's Primary Breed
* RASSE2 -> Dog's Secondary Breed
* GEBURTSJAHR_HUND -> Dog's Year of Birth
* GESCHLECHT_HUND -> Dog's Gender
* HUNDEFARBE -> Dog's Color
