## Setup

The Lahman data is a huge dataset of baseball statistics. See the
[overview of the Sean "Lahman" baseball database](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lahman).

```R
install.packages(c("Lahman"))
library(Lahman)
```

## Exercises

1. The `People` database has biographical information about the
   players. 
       
     * Make a histogram showing when players passed away 
         in the 20th century. Don't use the default bin width.
       
2. The [`AllstarFull`
   dataset](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lahman/versions/8.0-0/topics/AllstarFull) 
   
     * Make a bar chart showing the frequency of players being in
         "x" all-star games. Only include players with x>6. Fill the
         bars in with colors to denote Amerian League and National
         League player counts. 

3. Make a scatterplot showing year of death vs first year in the
   playoffs.

4. Make two bar charts of allstars counting how many bat with each hand.

    * count every all-star appearance once
    * count every player only once
    
5. Tag players with all-star appearances in the people data set.  Make
a box plot of salaries of players with all-star appearances vs without
all-star appearances.

6. Look at the [data available in the Lahman datasets](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Lahman/versions/8.0-0) and
   brainstorm ten questions you could answer.
