Intermediate Computer Science uses the
[DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org) environment and the [Picturing
Programs](http://PicturingPrograms.com) textbook. Use
[WeScheme](https://www.wescheme.org) if you cannot install programs, but
read the [notes on WeScheme]({{< relref
"ICS-WeScheme-Note.md">}}) because it is different in some
ways.

Eventually you will want to understand [why we learn
Racket]({{< relref "why-racket.md" >}}) instead of a more popular
language like Python.

## Extra Info: Online Course

The [Racket MOOC]({{< relref "e-courses.md" >}}) is a good place to look if you want more detail.
