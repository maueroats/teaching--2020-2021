Advice: begin with a small piece of the problem. The first section of
this article will show you how to write a function that selects the
correct color. The second section will show you how to modify your
function so it can select the correct match for anything.

## Third Color

We are going to write a function to select the color for the matching
third card. Examples of inputs are the columns "One" and "Two"
below. The output is in the "Result" column.

| One      |  Two    |  Result |
|----------|---------|---------|
| "purple" | "green" |   "red" |
| "green"  | "green" | "green" |

The signature of the method we are writing is:
```java
public static String findThirdColor(String one, String two) { ... }
```

We will need to give the function the list of possible colors, or it
won't know enough to do its job.

```java
String[] possible = {"purple", "red", "green" };
```

After that, follow the pseudocode logic:

```
if (one is not the same as two) {
  give the third one;
} else {
  give one or two, they are the same;
}
```

In class we chose to make an ArrayList holding all of the
possibilities and we removed the ones we found equal to `one` or
`two`. 

## Third Anything

The only part of the function above that is specific to the color is
the `possible` array. We can take that array an an input to the
function, then we will be able to use it on anything.

```java
public static String findThirdAnything(String[] possible, String one, String two) {
    // Step 0. fill the ArrayList with items from possible
    // Step *. Continue the same as findThirdColor.
}
```

Examples of using this function:
```java
String[] colors = {"purple", "red", "green"};
String[] shapes = {"oval", "squiggle", "diamond"};
String c = findThirdAnything(colors, "red", "green");
String s = findThirdAnything(shapes, "oval", "oval");
```
