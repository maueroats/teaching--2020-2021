The problem asks us to find the maximum and minimum number of sets that can be formed from a
set of 12 cards.

## Card

One big problem that came up was representing the data for a single card. The most popular
method was to make an array of String, for example:

```java
String[] c1 = {"3", "purple", "oval", "empty"};
```
    
This caused problems with the `contains` method.

```java
ArrayList<String[]> cards = new ArrayList<>();
cards.add(c1);
String[] c2 = {"3", "purple", "oval", "empty"}; // same as c1

if(cards.contains(c2)) {
   System.out.println("OK - works"); // nope
} else { 
   System.out.println("BAD - unexpected");  // this happens
}
```

### Why?

By default, Java uses `==` to compare two Objects (including arrays of strings) for
equality. That means they will only be considered equal if they occupy the same address in
memory.
    
### Simple Solution

The easiest solution, which I should have discussed more clearly, is to skip using the built-in
`contains` method and write your own. You could make a loop and compare all of the
corresponding Strings in the arrays with the `equals` method.

```java
public static boolean cards_same(String[] a, String[] b) {
  return Arrays.equals(a,b); //fancier than a for loop
}
```

After that you could write your own method to determine whether an `List` contains a
specific `String` array.

```java
public static boolean containsCard(List<String[]> xs, String[] y) {
  return false; // you write
}
```

### More Complex Solution

From one point of view, this mess was caused by not using a class when we should have.  If you
put the information in a `Card` class, it's more straightforward to define an [equals method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8180430/how-to-override-equals-method-in-java)
to deal with the problem when it comes up. I have deliberately made the one below really
compressed / hard to understand. Try rewriting it in your own way.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
public class Card {
    private String[] info;
    public Card(String[] info) {
      this.info = info;
    }
    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      return (o != null) && (o instanceof Card) && (Arrays.equals(info, ((Card)o).info));
    }
}
```

### Clever Solution

One clever idea I heard was to give every trait a number, like 0 for
"empty", and then form a four digit number to represent the card. This
will make all of your comparisons very fast because working with
numbers is much faster than working with Strings. It will also
eliminate the hassle of the `equals` method.

## Testing 

Here are some tests to check to make sure your function works correctly.
You should get in the habit of verifying you got things right by yourself!
Ask if you have trouble or don't understand the tests.

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
// ...
public void test_contains_card() {
  String[] c1 = {"3", "purple", "oval", "empty"};
  String[] c2 = {"3", "purple", "oval", "empty"};
  List<String[]> cards = new ArrayList<>();
  cards.add(c1);
  assertNotEquals(c1,c2);
  assertTrue(containsCard(cards, c2));
  System.out.println("test_contains_card: OK");
}
```
