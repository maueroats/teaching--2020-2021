`TreeSet` and `HashSet` both have requirements and things that can go
wrong. 

## TreeSet

A class can be used in a `TreeSet` if it implements the `Comparable`
interface.

That means in a `Card` class you need:
* `implements Comparable<Card>`
* `public int compareTo(Card other)`

A typical piece of a `compareTo` method using `String` fields `color`
and `shape` would look like this:
```java
public int compareTo(Card other) {
  int ans = (this.color).compareTo(other.color);
  if (ans == 0) {
    ans = (this.shape).compareTo(other.shape);
  }
  // ...
  return ans;
}
```

Remember that for numeric fields compareTo should be subtraction `(this.n) - (other.n)`.


## HashSet

There are no ordering requirements to use a `HashSet`, which might
lead you to think that any class will automatically work correctly.

Unfortunately, for a `HashSet` to work properly when you have written
a custom `equals` method, you also need to [write a
hashCode()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/113511/best-implementation-for-hashcode-method-for-a-collection)
method.

The rule for `hashCode()` is that `x.hashCode() != y.hashCode()` must
imply `x` cannot be `.equal` to `y`. The [default hashCode()
implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32454673) is a random
per-object number, which will not have this property if you have
changed `equals` to be something besides `==`.

## Takeaways

`TreeSet` is reasonable to work with in the context of AP Computer
Science A. `HashSet` requires details that are beyond what would
normally be in the course.
