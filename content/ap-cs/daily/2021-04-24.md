`TreeSet` and `HashSet` both have requirements and things that can go
wrong. 

## TreeSet

A class can be used in a `TreeSet` if it implements the `Comparable`
interface.

That means in a `Card` class you need:
* `implements Comparable<Card>`
* `public int compareTo(Card other)`

## HashSet

There are no ordering requirements to use a `HashSet`, which might
lead you to think that any class will automatically work correctly.

Unfortunately, for a `HashSet` to work properly when you have written
a custom `equals` method, you also need to [write a
hashCode()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/113511/best-implementation-for-hashcode-method-for-a-collection)
method.

The rule for `hashCode()` is that `x.hashCode() != y.hashCode()` must
imply `x` cannot be `.equal` to `y`. The [default hashCode()
implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32454673) is a random
per-object number, which will not have this property if you have
changed `equals` to be something besides `==`.
