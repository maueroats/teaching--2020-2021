description: "Discovering 0123 is not the same number as 123."

It took a comically long time for me to track down the reason that my
test below failed:
```java
int[] digits = {0,1,2,3};
assertEquals(0123, toNum(digits));
```

It turns out that integers with a leading 0 are read in octal (base
8). SMH. I should have known. Hexadecimal numbers starting with `0x`
are more familiar.

Try this experiment to see numbers written in a bunch of different bases:

```java
System.out.println(0b100); // base 2
System.out.println(0100);  // base 8
System.out.println(100);   // base 10
System.out.println(0x100); // base 16
```
