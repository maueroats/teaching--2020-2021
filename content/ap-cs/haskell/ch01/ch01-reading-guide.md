# Haskell introduction reading questions

1. Haskell is supposed to be a _purely functional language_. Unpack that:
    1. What does _pure_ mean?
    2. What is the difference between _functional_ and _imperative_? (The book is not so clear on this point. What do you think it says, in your own words?)

2. Haskell is _lazy_. What does this mean?

3. Haskell is _statically typed_. This could be unpacked, too. 
    1. What does _typed_ mean? 
    2. The word _static_ in English can me "not changing". How would you apply that meaning in this context?

4. When did work on Haskell begin?
