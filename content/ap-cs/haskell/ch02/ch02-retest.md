1. Create a single list consisting of all of the even numbers from 2 to 50
   followed by all of the odd numbers from 99 down to 51.

2. Make a list of all of the numbers from 1 to 10000 that are
   multiples of 17 and have square roots between 50 and 70. Display the
   list and how many you find.
   
2. Define the function f(x) = (x-1)(x-7).

   * Find ten points on the graph of y=f(x) with y>10.
   * Find ten points on the graph of y=f(x) with y<-5.

3. Write a function that takes in a list of x coordinates and returns
   a list of points on the graph of y=x^3 where y<=64.
