description: "Useful highlights from the chapter."

A list of the chapter contents, including past stumbling blocks.

* Create a list: `[5..13]` or `[5,10..100]` or `[ n^2 | n<-[1..100], even n]`
* Create a tuple: `(5,12)`
* Key to remember: head, tail, init, last, `:`, `++`
* Other list functions: maximum, minimum, sum, product, reverse
* More list functions: length, null, take, drop
* Sometimes useful: cycle, repeat, replicate
* Misc: `!!`, `zip`
* Double quotes make strings. 
* Single quotes make individual characters.
* Strings are lists of characters, so "dog" == ['d','o','g']
