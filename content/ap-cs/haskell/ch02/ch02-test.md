This is a test, please do it on your own and do not help others. You
are supposed to show your understanding of Haskell. Just getting an
answer might not show a good understanding.


1. Create the following list with less effort:
   `[31,35,39,43,47,...,431] `
   
2. Make a list of all of the odd numbers less than 1000 that are
   perfect squares. Notes:
   
      * 900 = 30^2 is a perfect square less than 1000, but it is not
        odd.
      * 10201 = 101^2 is an odd perfect square, but it is not less
        than 1000
        
3. Given $y=3x-12$, find 100 points on this line with $0 <= x <= 10$.

4. Write a function to select all of the numbers between 200 and 300
   out of a given list.
   
    `prob4 [100,250,290,310,210] == [250, 290, 210]`
