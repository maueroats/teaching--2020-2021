You may use the book, but not other reference materials, especially not Stack
Overflow or any of your old homework. 

1. Find the product of all odd negative integers greater than -2017.
   Create a tuple called `answer1` containing the sign (+1
   or -1) and the last two digits (the tens and units digit). Example:
   
        answer1 = (-1, 23)
   
2. Create a list of lists to represent the inside of [this VigÃ¨nere
   cipher table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vigen%C3%A8re_square_shading.svg).

3. (`base3`) Write a function to convert a number to a list
   representing the number in base 3.
   
        base3 (81+9+2*3+1) == [1,0,1,2,1]

4. (`inCirc`) Given an integer `w`,  create a list of all integers `x`
   that have the property that the point `(x,-x)` (meaning $y$ is the opposite of $x$) inside the circle of
   radius `2*w` centered at `(w,w)`. This means you are looking for
   integer coordinate points on the line $y=-x$ that are within
   distance $2*w$ of the point $(w,w)$. 
   
     Haskell will prefer that you call all of the points involved
     `Double`. The other choice is to write your own distance function
     and use `fromIntegral`. 

        inCirc :: Double -> [Double]

      You can use your own distance function or this one:
   
        dist :: (Double,Double) -> (Double,Double) -> Double
        dist (x0,y0) (x,y) = sqrt $ (x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2

    Here is an image showing the situation where $w=4$ and there are 9
    integer coordinate points that are distance $d \le 8$ from $(4,4)$ and on
    the line $y=-x$.

5. (`vig`) You can encode messages using the table from question 2. Write a
   single letter encoder by using the letter from the message to
   choose the row and the letter from the key to choose the column:
       
        vig :: Char -> Char -> Char
        vig msg key = undefined
        checkit = (vig 'C' 'X' == 'Z') -- should be True


6. (`vigen`) Enhance your single letter encoder from the previous question to
   encode messages. Take in two strings: the message and a key, and
   match up corresponding letters. (Repeat the key as necessary.)

     [An example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Description)
   using the secret key "LEMON".
   
        vigen :: String -> String -> String
        vigen "ATTACKATDAWN" "LEMON" == "LXFOPVEFRNHR"
