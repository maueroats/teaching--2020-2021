Old school multiplication problems have work that looks like this:

      123
     x 45
     ----
      615
     4920
     ----
     5535
     
The top two numbers are the inputs, and the bottom number is the
output, which is easy to get the computer to find. In between are the
partial products. 

You are writing a `partialProducts` function that produces a list of
partial products.

    partialProducts 123 45 == [615, 4920]

If you get this function to work, then consider how to make a partial
products function that works in different bases (showing everything in
the base you are working on).
