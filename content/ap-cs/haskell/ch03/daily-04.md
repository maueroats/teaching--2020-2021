We discussed how to write the number reverse function, `nr: Integer ->
Integer`. 

    nr 60201 == 10206

Helper functions:

* `digits 60201 == [6,0,2,0,1]`
* `undigits [1,0,2,0,6] == 10206`

We wrote those in class. You should make sure those work and complete
the writing of the `nr` function.

Using these ideas, you should also be able to finish the `hexDec`
function --- if you had troubles please look at it again.
