Write the type signature and function for each problem.

1. (`count7`) How many times does 7 appear in a given list of numbers?
2. (`skipEm`) The output list of numbers is the same as the input
   list, except every number from 50 through 70 is removed.
3. Make this string without any effort: `"zxvtrpnlj"`
4. Make a list of ordered pairs: the letter of the alphabet and its
   place in the ordinary order. Starts with `('a',1)`.
5. (`shuffler`) Given two lists of integers, interleave them into one
   list.
   
        shuffler [1,2,3] [10,20,30] == [1,10,2,20,3,30]
