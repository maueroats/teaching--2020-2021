1. In the game of Scrabble you try to fit a word into spaces with some
   letters already in place. In this question you will write a
   function to determine if a word fits into a certain space.
   
        wordFits :: String -> String -> Bool
        wordFits "jerk" "_or_" == False
        wordFits "work" "__r_" == True

  Along the way you may want to use a helper function to determine if
  characters from the same place match. 
  
        letterFits :: Char -> Char -> Bool
        letterFits 'j' '_' == True
        letterFits 'e' 'o' == False

  The strings given to `wordFits` will be the same length.
        
2. In the game of 24 you are supposed to find a way to combine four
   whole numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
   division, in order to get 24 as the final answer. 
   
   1. pairPossible produces all of the numbers that you can get from a
      single pair of numbers. Omit non-integral results of division.
      
          pairPossible 3 12 == [-9,9,15,36,4]
          pairPossible 3 4 == [-1,1,7,12]
          pairPossible 49 2 == [-47,47,51,98]

      Danger: 49/2 is not 24, so `pairPossible 49 2` should not
      include 24 in the list!
   

   2. allPairs produces a list of all of the possible two number pairs
      given a list of four numbers. 
      
          allPairs :: [Int] -> [(Int,Int)]
          allPairs [1,2,3,4] == [(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4)]
          
   3. allPossible1 produces a list of all numbers that could be
      produced by using any pair of numbers from the list. Duplicates
      are ok. 

## Advanced

* Make `allPairs` work for any length input list. 
* Make `choose k nums` that gives all `k` item subsets of `nums`.
* Finish the 24-solver. There are two different groupings that could
  lead to 24: `(((ab)c)d)` and `((ab)(cd))`. You can use your
  `allPairs` function but as you build all of the possibilities for
  four numbers, I think you will have to handle both of these cases
  separately.
  
  Examples: $(49 - 1) / (5 - 3)$ and $((15 / 3)+1)*4$ are both 24.
