  Write three tests, a signature, and the function for each.
{{% /alert %}}

1. `nearTen` [Logic-1](https://codingbat.com/prob/p193613). Given a
   positive Integer `n`, return True if `n` is within two of a
   multiple of ten.
2. `matchUp` [Array-2](https://codingbat.com/prob/p136254). Given two lists of
   the same number of `Int`, consider 
   the each pair of elements with the same index (same position in the
   list when lined up). Return the count of the number of times that
   the two elements differ by two or less, but are not equal.
   
Periods are short today.

**Extra credit.** Write a signature using class constraints:

```haskell
f x a y = if x == a then sqrt(y) else y
```
