The [testcases zip file](connect4.zip) contains all of the template files. 

You can also download them one by one:

* [Connect Four](ConnectFour.hs)
* [TestConnectFour](TestConnectFour.hs)
* [User Interface for Connect Four](UIConnectFour.hs)
* [Main method in its own file](Main.hs)

It may help you to start from **[my repl.it workspace](https://repl.it/NP9L/1)** with all of the 
testing code already in it. Your code should go in `ConnectFour.hs`. You may need
to edit some of the function names. The list of what they are supposed to be is
at the start.
