| Day | Date(s) | Project Assignment  |
|:---:|---------|---------------------|
| 1   | TBA 9   | Project assigned. Write `draw_board`. |
| 2-3 | TBA 11  | Plan, write, and test: `is_legal_move`. |
| 5   | TBA 12  | Plan `is_won` in class. Write and test at home. |
| 6   | TBA 15  | Project due. |
| -   | TBA 19   | Last day to turn in project. |

I expect this project to take 4-6 hours to complete over the course of
a week. If you spend less than 3 hours on the project you should read
the advanced notes about the minimax algorithm and (partially?)
implement it.

Expected times and other notes:

* `draw_board`: 1.0 hour, including class time
* `is_legal_move`: 0.5 hour
* `is_won`: 1.5-2 hours, including 0.5-1.0 hours planning time
Expect to use several helper functions. See [spoilers]({{% relref "spoilers.md#detecting-a-win" %}}) if needed.
* `make_move`: 1.0 hour, including class time. See [spoilers]({{% relref "spoilers.md#changing-entries-in-the-board" %}}) if needed.
