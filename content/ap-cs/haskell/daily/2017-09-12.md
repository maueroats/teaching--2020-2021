description: Technical details that came up while doing Chapter 2 Homework.

* Memorize how to write a basic main method:

  ```
    main = do putStrLn "Loaded"
  ```

* Use "--" (two dashes) to comment to the end of the line. This is
  equivalent to Racket ";" (semicolon).
  
* Function name rules:
    * Must begin with lowercase letter.
    * Hyphens (-) are not allowed in names.
	* Underscore (_) may be used instead.

    * Traditionally `camelCase` is used for functions. (First letter
lowercase, then uppercase each new word.)

* We will learn about the `$` sign soon, but it is a substitute for
  putting parentheses from somewhere to the end of the line. That means
  ```
      putStrLn ( show ( grapher f 0 10 ) )
  ```
  could be written as
  ```
      putStrLn $ show $ grapher f 0 10
  ```
