description: Battleship and homework review.
---

We discussed problem 7 from the homework. You should finish it based on the discussion. 

Mentioned from Chapter 5: `type` to make short ways to say types. Examples:

```haskell
    type Pt = (Int,Int)
    type Ship = [Pt]
    type Shots = [Pt]
```


We wrote the function `is_sunk` for battleship. 

Functions we discussed:

* [`&&`]: Join two Boolean values with logical and.
* [`and`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:and): Join a list of Boolean values with logical and.
* [`all`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:any): Apply a tester function and then join all of the values together with "and".

All of these functions have counterparts for logical or; they are: `||`, `or`, `any`.
