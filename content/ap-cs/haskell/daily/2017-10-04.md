1. Without10 ([source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p196976)). Take a list of numbers and remove all of the tens. The remaining numbers shift toward the start of the list and zeros fill in at the end.

2. NotAlone ([source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p169506)).
We will say that an element in an array is "alone" if there are values
before and after it, and those values are different from it. Return a
version of the list where every instance of the given value
which is alone is replaced by whichever value to its left or right is
larger.

3. TwoTwo ([source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p102145)). True if every two is 
that appears in the list is next to another two.

4. pre4 ([source](http://codingbat.com/prob/p100246)).
Given a non-empty array of ints, return a new array containing the
elements from the original array that come before the first four in the
original array.
