We worked on the [Cow
Signal](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=665)
problem. 

To make your writing simpler, you should use the signature below. The
very last step of printing out everything on its own line is not an
important part of the problem.

```haskell
cowSignal :: Int -> [String] -> [String]
```

Printing on multiple lines: use `\n` like this: 
```haskell
x = "This\nstring\nprints\non\nmany\nlines"
main = do putStrLn x
```
