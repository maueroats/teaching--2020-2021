[Square
Pasture](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=663). There
are two rectangular pastures, each given by the coordinates of their
upper left and lower right points. The two pastures do not
overlap. Find the minimum area required for a single square pasture to
enclose the two rectangle pastures.

```haskell
sqPasture :: ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> ((Int,Int),(Int,Int)) -> Int
sqPasture ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) ((x3,y3),(x4,y4)) = undefined
```

## Additional Exercise

[List run of 3](https://codingbat.com/prob/p159979). Given a list of
`Int`, return true if the array contains either three even or three
odd values all next to each other. Lists of length less than 3 are
definitely false because they don't even have three values.
