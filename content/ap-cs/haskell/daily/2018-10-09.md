You have a week to complete this project. You will need to find time
to work on it outside of class.

Due: Monday, October 15, 2018

## Option 1 (Recommended)

Do both of the following, including at least three tests for each function:

* Six coding bat problems. Recommended sources

    - [Array-2](https://codingbat.com/java/Array-2),
    - [String-2](https://codingbat.com/java/String-2), 
    - [Logic-1](https://codingbat.com/java/Logic-1). Other choices
permitted, ask.

* One Computing Olymiad problem, Bronze level. (Ex: [Dec
  2015](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=dec15results) or [Jan 2016](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=jan16results))

## Option 2 (Advanced, A+)

Write [Connect Four]({{% relref "ap-cs/haskell/connect-four" %}}). There is a
project walkthrough with a list of functions to write and notes on the
trouble spots.

## Option 3 (Struggling, B)

Do ten CodingBat problems instead of adding the Bronze Computing
Olympiad problem.
