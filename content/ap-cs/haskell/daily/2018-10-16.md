1. [notAlone](https://codingbat.com/prob/p169506). 

     ```haskell
     notAlone :: [Int] -> Int -> [Int]
     notAlone nums x = undefined
     ```

2. [Team Tic Tac Toe](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=831)

     * Write teamWins to determine if a given team wins a given three
       in a row.
     
         ```haskell
         teamWins :: String -> [Char] -> Bool
         teamWins row team = undefined
         ```
         
     * Write allThrees, which gets all of the three in a row segments 
     from a board.
     
          ```haskell
          allThrees :: [String] -> [String]
          allThrees board = undefined
          ```
     
     * Write allTeams, which produces a list of all possible teams.
     
           ```haskell
           allTeams :: [String]
           ```

     * Combine the previous functions to solve the problem.

3. (Bonus.) [Family
   Tree](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=833). I use
   `momList` to be the list of pairs of strings (mother, child).
   
   * `findParent momList cow` produces []  or a list containing the
     name of the parent of the given cow in a list.

   * `parentList momList cow` produces a list containing the mother,
     grandmother, etc. of the given cow. The result could be empty if
     the cow has no known mother.
   
   * `isRelated momList cow1 cow2` gives True if the cows are
   related at all.
   
   ```haskell
   isRelated ::  [(String,String)] -> String -> String -> Bool
   isRelated familyTree cow1 cow2 = undefined
   ```
