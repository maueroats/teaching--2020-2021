Functions you need to define. Lines include values that will let the
program run (although incorrectly).

```
is_game_over :: Board -> Bool
is_game_over board = undefined -- False -- and it will run

winner :: Board -> Player
winner board = undefined -- 0 -- and it will run

is_legal_move :: Board -> Square -> Bool
is_legal_move board n = undefined -- True -- and it will run

drawBoard :: Board -> [String]
drawBoard board = undefined  -- ["Broken"] -- and it will run

square_next :: Player -> Square -> Square
square_next player sq = undefined -- sq -- will run broken

distribute :: Board -> Player -> Square -> Int -> 
    (Board, Player, Square, Int, String)
distribute board player sq n = undefined    

-- FIXME UTILITY FUNCTIONS
get1k :: Board -> Square -> Int
get1k board square = undefined -- 0 -- if you want it to run broken
zero1k :: Board -> Square -> Board
zero1k board sq = undefined -- board -- if you want it to run broken
add1k :: Board -> Square -> Int -> Board
add1k board square stones = undefined -- board -- if you want it to run
```
