The [haybales](http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=666) problem 
is from Bronze 1, December 2016. In this directory you can download 
the [starter code](usaco-y2016-m12.tar.bz2). If you are 
new to Unix, you unpack it with the command `tar zvxf usaco-y2016-m12.tar.bz2`. 
Inside there is a `README.md` file that has a few more instructions.
