description: "Animal and CarnivoreAnimal."

The `Animal` is an abstract class with the following methods:

* `int beEaten()`: returns the number of calories provided 
* `void gainCalories (int amount)`: increases number of calories. 

When you construct an `Animal`, the
constructor needs to know how many calories are in the animal.

`CarnivoreAnimal` is a concrete subclass of `Animal`. It also has a
method `void eat(Animal other)`. This method causes the
`CarnivoreAnimal` to gain the calories provided by the other Animal
(found using the `beEaten()` method).
