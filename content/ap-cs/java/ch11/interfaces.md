## Example: mouse handler
A good example of an `interface` is the
[MouseListener](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/MouseListener.html). This
interface contains a function to be called when a mouse clicks on
something (actually different functions for press, release, and
complete click). 

Making this an interface means any class you create can have the
ability to work with mouse events.
