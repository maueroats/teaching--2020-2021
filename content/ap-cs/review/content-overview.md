The college board has two sites: a [course](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course)
site and an [exam](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam)
site. The former gives an overview of the course, the latter contains
detailed information about the contents of the exam.

I will highlight what I think is the most
useful information.

### Past Exams

College Board [useful practice exam
site](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam)

earlier exams.

* Free Response questions from [2019](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-frq-computer-science-a.pdf), and from [2018 and earlier](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions).
