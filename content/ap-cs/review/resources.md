Prepare with the idea you will need to take a placement test when you
go to college. If you are taking more CS classes at Whitney Young, make
sure you focus on learning problem solving now.

* AP official all-courses [review channel on YouTube](
  https://www.youtube.com/user/advancedplacement?SFMC_cid=EM294654-&rid=76873400). 
* Specific AP CS A [review
  playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoGgviqq4845xKOY11PnkE7aqJC7-bYrd).
* [Writing subclasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0tcyR1EPl4&list=PLoGgviqq4845xKOY11PnkE7aqJC7-bYrd&index=3&t=0s), 
  content starts at about 8:40.
* [AP CS A Review 2020](https://bit.ly/CSA_ExamReview2020), a
  comprehensive review of String, arrays, classes, recursion,
  etc. Some materials are paired with the videos from the AP CS A
  playlist (see above); match materials to videos by looking at the
  units.
* [Runestone AP CS
  Review](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/apcsareview/index.html):
  Free. It does not have a ton of repetitive exercises, but the ones it has are
  on point. There are some in every content area. 

* Free Response questions [from 2019](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-frq-computer-science-a.pdf), and from [2018 and earlier](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions).

## Exam Preparation Books

As a rough guide, the [Barron's AP Computer Science
A](https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-AP-Computer-Science-7th/dp/1438005946)
text is too easy and the [Be Prepared for the AP Computer Science Exam
in
Java](https://www.amazon.com/Prepared-Computer-Science-Exam-Java/dp/0982477538)
book by Litvin and Litvin is too difficult. I have not read the
Princeton Review text. Later versions are probably essentially the
same as the links above.
