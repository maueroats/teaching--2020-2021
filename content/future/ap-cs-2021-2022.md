AP Computer Science A is a college level course that teaches the
fundamentals of computer science programming.

In 2021-2022, the course will teach:

* Python (until Thanksgiving)
* Java Fundamentals 
* Data Structures in Java (post-AP)

## Overview

There are two phases of the class that most people are interested in:
the introduction in Python and then the main part in Java.

### Python

We will learn Python based on Allen Downey's _How to Think
Like a Computer Scientist_
([Online](http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/), 
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362)).

We will continue to work on project management skills, writing games
like [peg jumper](https://www.mathplayground.com/peg_jumper.html),
[nine man's
morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris), 
[Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
or
[Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).

These will quickly involve working with lists.

### Java

We use a mix of sources. The best online practice site is
[CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java). We have used Litvin's [Java
Methods](http://www.skylit.com/javamethods/index.html) in the past.
During the pandemic year we used [Blue Pelican
Java](http://www.bluepelicanjava.com/) - the book can be downloaded
for $0.

Java is a [blub language](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) designed
for big business use. Languages like Java are everywhere. You will
definitely use them if you continue in computer science. However, it
is not usually considered sleek and elegant. 

### Data Structures

At the end of the course we will make our own homemade versions of
important data structures like linked lists, trees, and hash
tables. These cartoon versions will give you an intuition how the
"real thing" works without all of the details.
