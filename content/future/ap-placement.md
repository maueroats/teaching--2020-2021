If you have already taken Intermediate Computer Science, there is no
need to take a placement test. See the [AP Preparation]({{% relref
"ap-prep" %}}) page for the skills you should have acquired.

You should only take AP computer science without Intermediate CS if you have
some significant programming experience.

Write these functions and send them to doc mo (amauer-oats@cps.edu):
