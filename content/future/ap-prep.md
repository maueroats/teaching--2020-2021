This page will help you decide if you should take AP CS A or
Intermediate CS.

If you are taking Intermediate Computer Science and in Jauary 2021 you
can make an animation using `cond`, you will be prepared. Your end of
the year goals should include:
* use a `struct` to make a more complex animation
* use a `list` to work with an unknown number of things
* debug code, probably using DrRacket's Stepper and `check-expect`

AP Computer Science Principles is not a class that focuses on
programming, you should ask about whether Intermediate CS or AP CS A
would be more appropriate.

### Self-check 1: January

Here is a project that everybody in Intermediate Computer Science should be
able to do in January: make a vertical slider controlled by the
mouse. Clicking or dragging on the slider moves a cross bar which also
controls the amount of blue in the background. 
* When the bar is at the bottom, the background is a dark blue (0,0,100)
* When the bar is at the top, the background is pure blue (0,0,255)

An advanced student would be able to make a slider that changes the
background from "light sky blue" at the bottom to "royal blue" at the top.

### Self-check 2: May

Here is a project that everyone in Intermediate Computer Science
should be able to do in May: write a function that takes in a list of
points / ordered pairs $(x,y)$ and a single point $(x_0,y_0)$, and
puts out the point in the list that is closest to $(x_0,y_0)$.
