## Do I need lots of math? 

You can be successful in computer science without being good at math,
but it is more challenging. 

You should take all of the math classes you can.

Develop an **understanding why** you are doing things in math
class. That understanding of _why_ math works translates directly into thinking
about _why_ a computer is doing the things it is doing.

There is a lot more **problem solving** in a computer science class than
in a many math classes. Solving the same problem over and over to
build a skill happens a lot in math classes. While you are learning
computer science, you have to learn how to solve new problems in every
assignment. The expectation is that you will be able to use the ideas
you learn in new ways.

Practice **planning** what you are going to do before you do it. You can
do this in math class by thinking about what is going to happen in a
problem before you do it. When people fail to solve programming
problems, it is frequently because they are trying to write a program
without a plan.

Computer science takes some different skills than math class. You can
be successful in computer science without being successful in math
class. However, many people find that the same skills help in both
classes. Bad arithmetic or algebra skills? You'll be fine. Find it
hard to learn new concepts, or apply ideas in new ways? CS could be
challenging. 


## What is the difference between AP CS A and AP CS Principles?

CS Principles is a general introduction to computing. In general, you
should take this class if you are not very comfortable with
programming. Harvard's CS50 course (similar to CS Principles) reports
that 50% of their students described themselves as "less comfortable"
(with computing). You should not take CS Principles if you already
know how to program.

If you have no experience but really want to learn programming, you
should take Intermediate Computer Science (our equivalent of
Northwestern's [EECS
111](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/111.html)). This
class is described as a "required core course in the CS curriculum".

Colleges consider these two courses differently:

* Harvard counts their equivalent of CS Principles as a [distribution
requirement](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/spring/faqs/#does-cs50-satisfy-any-college-requirements). 

* Northwestern University gives elective credit for CS Principles, but
may allow CS A to fulfill a required course for a major.
