## Planning and Testing

Write every part of the design process **except** the function. 
Do write tests!

* count-factors: take a number N and find out how many numbers 1,2,...,N divide N.

* angle-pts: take in six numbers (x1,y1) (x2,y2) (x3,y3) and give the angle in degrees made by line segments going to those three points in that order.

* Classwork: make a point follow the graph of y = sqrt(100^2-x^2) from x=-95 to x=95
(Don't like math? Use the [graph of the function y = 3x+50](better-mathgraph.rkt) on the same interval.)

* Homework: 8.3.6 page 142 (PDF page 153). Parabola graph.
