In this animation you copy [AimBooster.com](https://aimbooster.com),
but simplified so you can make it with what you know from Chapter 20.

* A single circle is at a random place.
* Radius increases.
* Clicking on the circle gives you points inversely proportional to
  the radius (maybe 100/radius).
* When the circle is hit, it disappears and another starts growing.
* When the circle reaches a certain radius it disappears.
* After missing three circles, the game is over.
