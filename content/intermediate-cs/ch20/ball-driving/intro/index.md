You move a little ball around the screen by positioning your mouse
inside the control center in the upper right corner of the screen. The
position of the mouse relative to the "origin" of the axes in the
control center detemines which way the ball will move (and how far). 

Motion is caused by mouse-events, so the ball does not move unless you
are moving or clicking the mouse.

When the ball is entirely inside the target circle, the game is over
and you win.
