The [posn math worksheet](posnmath-20D.pdf) starts with the ideas on a
number line (1 dimension) and then changes over to working with posns
(2 dimensions).

The important ideas are:

* Posns work a lot like numbers on the number line. Know the analogies
  (below).
* Think $+$ and $-$ even if you have to say `posn-add` and
  `posn-subtract`.
* Distance from the origin on the number line is `abs`; in 2d use
  `posn-length`.
* Adding $A+B$ takes a point at $A$ and moves it in direction $B$. 
* Subtracting $-B+A$ or $A-B$ finds the motion from $B$ to $A$. Experiment to
  understand why the $B$ has the minus sign not the $A$.
  
Pacing: expect to be able to do and discuss the first two pages in
about 45 minutes.
