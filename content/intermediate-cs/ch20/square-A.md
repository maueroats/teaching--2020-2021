description: "A simply silly 'game' to practice win conditions."
---

* A little square randomly drifts around the screen. 
* You win if you hit the "w" key.
* Hitting the "r" key moves the square back to its starting position.
* When you win, some win screen appears and the animation stops.

Items to practice:

* `stop-when` clause in big bang
* win screen draw-handler

Extras:

* You lose if you hit the "q" key.
* Also win if you click on the square.
