description: "Create a new struct to hold a number and a posn."
---

You are going to create a new struct `np` that remembers both a number and a posn. 

1. Data definition: write a human-understandable description for `np`.

2. Write the Racket code to define the `np` structure.

3. Write two `check-expect` to verify that you get out the same information that 
you put in to the structure.

4. Design and test `np-set-num: np(old) number -> np(new)` that sets the number in a given number-position structure.

5. Design and test `np-set-posn: np(old) posn -> np(new)` that makes the posn of the `np` into the given posn. 

6. Go do Exercise 21.6.3 using the idea from this worksheet.
