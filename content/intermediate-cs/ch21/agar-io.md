I hope you know the game Agar.io. A circle moves around the screen toward
the mouse. There is a "food". When the circle touches (eats) the food, the food disappears and the circle gets larger. The food reappears in a random location. 

Starter code: [agar-io.rkt](agar-io-checks.rkt)

Advanced:

* As the circle gets larger, it moves more slowly.
* When the mouse is further from the center of the circle, it moves more quickly.
