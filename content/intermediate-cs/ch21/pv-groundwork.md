1. Make before and after sketches of the ball bouncing off of the top of the screen. Include:

    + position
    + velocity (before and after!)
    
2. Write `should-bounce-top?: pv -> boolean`. Make sure to write checks!

3. Write `bounce-vertical: pv -> pv` to change the velocity as needed.

4. Begin typing your animation. Make sure to test your code as you go along. Don't wait until you find out it doesn't work to test it.
