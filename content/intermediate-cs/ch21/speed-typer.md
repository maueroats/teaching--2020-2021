You are going to create a typing game - type a given word as fast as you
can. 

{{% figure src="speed-type.png" width="200" %}}

We will keep track of the word, the letters typed so far, and the time
that has passed since the start of the game.

## Planning

* We decided on the kind of  structure we wanted for a model.
* We listed all of the functions and what they were going to do.
* We wrote check-expects as a class.

You should find check-expects shared on the Google Classroom after we
have written them.

## Writing Tips

* Please write a signature and purpose for each function. 
* Use the "inventory" strategy to figure out the structure of your
  function.
* Test one case of a conditional and be sure it works before
  continuing on to write more.
* Never leave your code in a state where you cannot "run". Without
  frequent feedback from the computer it will be _extremely_ difficult
  to get the program to work.
