In addition to Chapters 22-23 in Picturing Programs, students in the past have found these resource useful:

* [How to Design Programs, Part II](http://htdp.org/2018-01-06/Book/part_two.html).
* [Pairs and Lists](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pairs.html) in the [Racket Guide](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html?q=Racket%20guide).
