Read the [rules on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Rules). A play must
bracket and flip at least one of the opponent's pieces.

You can play [reversi online](https://cardgames.io/reversi/) if you
need to get familiar with the game. Don't waste a lot of time on.
Once you have a working two-player reversi, then you can start
thinking about a computer player.

We will start with simpler / stylized versions and work our way up to
