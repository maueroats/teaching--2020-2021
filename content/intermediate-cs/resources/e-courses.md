The best resource I am aware of is Gregor Kiczales' course [How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x). The course is available for free through edX. 

## Kiczales Course Structure

The two most important parts of the course (from my point of view) are:

* **Module 1b: How to Design Functions.** The design process.

* **Module 3a: How to Design Worlds.** Big-bang.

## Other Resources

Signing up for a free online course is too much commitment? You could browse
[the YouTube playlists of Professor Kiczales](https://www.youtube.com/user/gregorkiczales/playlists). The first video of Summer 110 Weeks 3-4 is an introduction to big-bang.
