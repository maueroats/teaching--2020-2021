## Part A

You are working in people coordinates to determine if a point is
inside this 200x100 shape. The rounded corners are quarters of radius
50 circles. There is an animation to demonstrate, but you do _not_
need to write the animation!

{{% figure src="final-bread-1.png" %}}

1. Create this shape in DrRacket.
1. The purpose of `in-shape?: number(x) number(y) -> boolean` is to
return true if the point (x,y) is inside this shape. Write:
     1. Write a check-expect that returns true.
     2. Write a check-expect that returns false even though the point
        (x,y) is inside the rectangle with $0\le x \le 200$ and $0 \le
        y \le 100$.
3. Write the `in-shape?` function.

## Part B

1. Simplify as much as possible.

```
(define (clean-teeth? minutes-brushing toothbrush? sugar-toothpaste?)
  (and (boolean=? true toothbrush?)
       (and (boolean=? sugar-toothpaste? false)
            (booolean=? (not (< minutes-brushing 2))
                        true))))
```

2. Identify the type of model and write the draw handler (only!). A
   radius 10 solid red circle rotates around just inside the perimeter
   of a solid yellow circle of radius 100. The red circle should be
   able to follow the mouse around the circle.

<table>
<tr>
<td> {{% figure src="final-red-1.png" width="100" %}}  </td>
<td> {{% figure src="final-red-2.png" width="100" %}} </td>
</tr>
</table>
   
3. Make an animation that will show a given word until you click
 again.  Clicking on a 50x50 square the lower right corner shows
 "woof". Clicking on the same sized square in the lower left corner
 shows "rowr". If you click anywhere else it should show nothing.
 
 The red dots below show where the clicks occurred.

<table>
<tr>
<td> {{% figure src="final-speak-0.png" width="100" %}} </td>
<td> {{% figure src="final-speak-1.png" width="100" %}} </td> 
<td> {{% figure src="final-speak-2.png" width="100" %}} </td>
</tr>
</table>
