You should have already completed Part A, programming the `in-shape?`
function.

## Part B

1. Simplify as much as possible.

```
(define (clean-teeth? minutes-brushing toothbrush? toothpaste?)
  (and (boolean=? true toothbrush?)
       (and (boolean=? sugar-toothpaste? false)
            (booolean=? (not (< minutes-brushing 2))
                        true))))
```

2. Identify the type of model and write the draw handler (only!). A
   radius 10 solid red circle rotates around just inside the perimeter
   of a solid yellow circle of radius 100.
