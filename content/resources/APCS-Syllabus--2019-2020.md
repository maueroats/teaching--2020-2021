This document gives information specific to the AP Computer Science course.
See the [all course syllabus information]({{< relref "Generic-CS-Syllabus.md" >}}) as well. 

## AP Review

We will do approximately three weeks of AP review before the AP exam. Second semester grades will be significantly impacted by AP test preparation. 

Many people benefit from outside preparation. Start in February. As a rough guide, the [Barron's AP Computer Science A](https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-AP-Computer-Science-7th/dp/1438005946) text is too easy and the [Be Prepared for the AP Computer Science Exam in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Prepared-Computer-Science-Exam-Java/dp/0982477538) book by Litvin and Litvin is too difficult. I have not read the Princeton Review text.

In recent years Whitney Young's AP CS pass rate has been: 93%, 100%,
and 100% so you will be prepared. The last two years 
we have had 70% and 50% of students earn the highest mark (5) on the
test. Studying matters if you want to achieve the highest mark.
