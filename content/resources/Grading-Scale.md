The most common question people have is how grades are
computed.

## Grading weights and scale

| Percent | Category                       |
|:-------:|--------------------------------|
| 10      | Final Exam/Project (Quarterly) |
| 45      | Tests and Quizzes (individual) |
| 45      | Participation (incl. homework) |


We use the standard Whitney Young grading scale (90+ A, 80+ B, 70+ C, 60+ D, below 60 F).

Class participation will be four points per day. You must be present and engaged in the class activities for the entire class to earn all of the points.

## Exceptional circumstances

Please contact your teacher if you have a **very** unusual
circumstance (extended illness, international competition,
etc.). Ordinary events causing you to miss a day or two of school are
not in that category.
