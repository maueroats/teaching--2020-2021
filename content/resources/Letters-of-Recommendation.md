The most important contribution I can make to your application is
concrete evidence of some of the claims you make about yourself. I can
also address things that are not visible in your application (e.g.,
integrity, git) and things that you cannot bring up yourself (e.g.,
poor grade in another class due to irresponsible teaching).

* Tell me about something you worked hard at.
* What project did you do (in my class) that you are most proud of?
  (Any similar accomplishments ok.)
* What topics did you find difficult to understand, and what did you
  do about it?
* Big projects: usually someone I am writing for has completed some
  kind of larger project, either in my class or outside. Tell me about
  at least one.
* How have you grown over the years that I have known you?
* What has made you successful?

It is important that I give specific examples to back up general
assertion that I make. You are much more likely to remember particular
things that you have done than I am. Please help me remember when you
answer these questions!

## Closing

* It's not done until you hear from me that it is done. Continue to
  talk to me about when it will be done until it is complete. In the
  worst case scenario, you can sit in the room and answer questions as
  I write it. **Do not assume I will complete the letter with no
  interaction from you!**

* Letters are generally done at least 24 hours before the
  deadline. If that will not be the case, you should have
  communication from me.

* Naviance should show the correct dates for your college apps. If it
  shows January 1 and you are applying early decision, that's going to
  be a problem. Make double-sure I am aware if the dates shown are wrong.
  
* If I ask you questions and don't get a response in a reasonable
  time, the letter will not be written. (Believe it or not some people
  don't respond in a week or more!)
