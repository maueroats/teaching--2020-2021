**Wanted**: A snapshot of one of the parts of your career that you
find most interesting, with enough details to make it feel "real". 

**Who?** Anyone whose work involves or _could involve_ automation or
computer assistance. 

**Why?** Students benefit from a broad idea of possible career paths,
especially careers that are not "popular" in high school. They need to
hear what a career is like so they begin to consider it a real option.

**Breadth of possibilities**:
Anything ranging from tasks that "should be" automated to things that
are already.

* Repetitive data analysis (counting bills passed the Illinos House
  and Senate)..
* Cutting-edge computer simulation of some process.
* Custom woodwork that is not automated, explaining why not 
* CNC mill operator: explain the level of exactness for the work, how
  to measure fine tolerances, come demonstrate some of the measurement
  tools or bring a small group to the shop. Explain how computer
  control has improved the process, and a systematic issue that
  remains. 
* Mechanical engineer in charge of some fickle fabrication process,
  with a discussion of how to find the source of the problems.
* Structural engineer at UIUC: pictures of failure modes of reinforced
  concrete pillar, discuss forces a work, outline lab research program
  to detect cracking by some new simulation method.
* Software engineer
* Computer security - penetration tester.

**Include Details?**
Yes! Details make the difference between totally real challenges and
generalities ignored by students. 

An interviewer (a student or me) can help flesh out ideas and figure
out a good level of detail to include, and potentially do background
work or presentation preparation for you.
