Senior-itis is an affliction in which seniors no longer feel any
motivation to do work in school. They don't care about what they are
learning, they feel it is pointless, they disengage.

At the root, senioritis is a symptom; years of external motivation are
the cause. External motivation is a form of motivation that comes from
outside - grades, candy, money. Opposite of external motivation is
_internal_ motivation - doing something for the joy of
learning, to live a morally upright life, or because you value the
experiences you will have in the doing.

## A virtuous cycle

Students and teachers (ideally) live in a kind symbiotic
relationships. Students trying harder makes teachers want to teach
more. The better a class goes, the more time is spent on preparing for
it - by students and teachers alike. Seniors who give up on learning
break this virtuous cycle, leading to sophomores not trying to
understand what is going on in a class - giving up years before they
are really done with school. Quitting that early means they will be
unprepared for any future classes, since they don't really have half
of the work from their sophomore year.

## Computer Science is Art

(Possibly unrelated to the above.)

After gaining a small amount of technical skill, sometimes people are
tempted to quit improving. When Picasa was a teenager (14 years old),
he could already
[draw very
well](https://www.nga.gov/features/slideshows/picasso-the-early-years.html#slide_2). Imagine
if he had quit, satisfied that his work was better than other kids his
age.

Computer science is an art as much as technical skill. You should
strive to write short, elegant code. Code full of ugly hacks, "just
get it done" work cannot be used to build something complex. The
burden of all of the code, the inappropriate levels of generality
all mixed together, makes it harder and harder to think about the goal
you intend to reach. 

In practice computer programming requires a high level
of abstraction and organizational skills. Work to develop
them. Designing and writing a (kind of simple) game is a good test of
your skills. Try it!
